Objective
################################
This guide, along with the provided scripts and sample app & services, is designed to help explore and demonstrate the use-cases of the F5 Distributed Cloud platform (xC), including F5 Distributed Cloud AppStack, Multi-Cloud Networking (MCN) and Edge Compute.

You can use the included scripts to deploy the WooCommerce sample app, which represents a traditional 3-tier app architecture (backend + database + frontend). With F5 Distributed Cloud Services, you can easily deploy and securely network these app services to create a distributed app model that spans across: 

- Customer Edge (CE) public cloud 

- Retail Branch (AppStack on a private cloud)

- Regional Edge (RE) 


The guide walks through the key use-cases for this distributed app architecture via several modules, all based on the following scenario.


Scenario
################################

.. figure:: ./assets/overview_0.png

The BuyTime Online & Retail scenario is a representative example of a shared Retail Branch + Online eCommerce architecture, where a traditional 3-tier app built on WooCommerce (powered by WordPress + MySQL) is used in both deployment models:

- The Retail Branch Kiosk provides recommendations and processes orders for in-store shoppers. The key requirements for this scenario are ease of deployment and configuration of the Retail Branch Kiosks, as well as the ability to quickly and securely connect to other services, including the recommendation engine service that runs in each branch and the central inventory database that runs in the public cloud. 
- The Online .com site provides typical eCommerce capabilities and is augmented with modern online promotion features. The key requirements are a quick response time for time- and latency-sensitive online promotions, similar to Amazonâ€™s Lighting Deals, as well as high security for both in-branch and online eCommerce operations.

For simplicity, this scenario re-uses the standard WooCommerce datasets for a clothes shop. The modules below lay out a framework for connecting and managing the distributed app services for this scenario, with a focus on the three core use-cases.


Use-cases / Module Overview 
################################

F5 Distributed Cloud Services (xC) enable a consistent deployment, management, and security model for applications, regardless of where they are run. In this scenario, a fictitious retailer named BuyTime will use xC AppStack to create a consistent deployment topology for an in-store Kiosk shopping experience by utilizing a traditional 3-tier app stack: WooCommerce frontend + backend & MariaDB. This topology can run in multiple Retail Branches with identical configuration, management, and security policies applied.

The following three use-cases are the key components of this guide and are represented in each of the modules:

**MODULE 1**

.. figure:: ./assets/overview_1.png

The HTTP Load Balancer can be utilized to securely connect Retail Branches running in-store Kiosks on AppStack (Compute @ Edge) to a VM hosting the shopping recommendation service. Each of these Kiosks can leverage the App Mesh and Multi-Cloud Networking features built into the xC App Stack to securely connect to internal and external services.
The BuyTime Retail Kiosk uses an external recommendation engine, which simulates a common use-case for a Machine Learning (ML) service that can be deployed on a VM with a GPU (Recommendation ML Service for compute-intensive tasks on VM w/ GPU). This engine processes images of clothes or accessories uploaded from the Kiosk and makes recommendations for other matching clothes/accessories.
To simplify the scenario for this demo, the sample app uses a mock service that returns an image based on specified criteria instead of using TensorFlow or a similar platform. We also provide a link to the recommendation service deployed in our cloud, so there is no need to run a VM in your network. However, we have included the scripts to run the Docker on your VM if you would like to deploy and use your own.

**MODULE 2**

.. figure:: ./assets/overview_2.png

In module two, we focus on configuring Multi-Cloud Networking for the BuyTime App. The TCP Load Balancer is utilized to securely connect and synchronize branch databases with the central inventory and order databases deployed in the public cloud on the Customer Edge (CE).

It's worth noting that the TCP Load Balancer operates on Layer 4 of the OSI model, which is the Transport Layer. It forwards traffic to backend servers based on the source IP address and port and destination IP address and port, making it an ideal choice for load balancing TCP traffic.

By using the TCP Load Balancer, you can ensure that the inventory and order data is always up-to-date and accurate while providing secure networking between the central database in the CE and the Retail branch.

**MODULE 3**

.. figure:: ./assets/overview_3.png

In this scenario, the Regional Edge is used with an HTTP Load Balancer to enhance eCommerce capabilities with time- and latency-sensitive promotional capabilities. This can be achieved by deploying a slightly modified version of the WooCommerce app with a different theme and modules.

Similarly, the same WooCommerce app can also be deployed, connected, and secured on the Customer Edge (CE) in a public or private cloud. By making some minor changes to the theme and modules, the app can be used to drive an eCommerce site with a set of time-limited, low-latency online promotional services similar to Amazon's Lightning Deals.


Pre-Requisites 
################################
 
------------------------------------------------------------
Create mK8s resource
------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, we will need to create a managed Kubernetes (mK8s) cluster. To do that, log into the Console and navigate to the **Distributed Apps** service.

MODULE 1
################################

In this Module we are going to deploy BuyTime Retail Kiosk using AppStack created within the Pre-requisites section, create an HTTP LB for the Kiosk, and connect the Retail Branches running in-store Kiosk on AppStack to the Recommendation Service using the created HTTP LB.  

------------------------------------------------------------
Deploy kiosk
------------------------------------------------------------

In order to deploy the kiosk by running the following command, we will need the Kubeconfig which we downloaded in the `Get mK8s Kubeconfig`_ section in Pre-requisites. After getting the Kubeconfig, proceed to the CLI and run the following command to deploy the Kiosk:

::

    > kubectl --kubeconfig ./your_mk8s_kubeconfig_global.yaml apply -f ./deployments/appstack-mk8s-kiosk.yaml

    namespace/branch-a created
    deployment.apps/mysql-deployment created
    service/mysql-service created
    deployment.apps/wordpress-deployment created
    service/wordpress-service created
    deployment.apps/kiosk-deployment created
    service/kiosk-service created

After the command is executed, we can verify the deployment by executing the following command:

::

    > kubectl --kubeconfig ./your_mk8s_kubeconfig_global.yaml get deployments -n branch-a

    NAME                   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    kiosk-deployment       1/1     1            1           10m
    mysql-deployment       1/1     1            1           10m
    wordpress-deployment   1/1     1            1           10m


If the kiosk is deployed and running correctly, the **1/1** value will appear in the READY column. 

------------------------------------------------------------
Ð¡reate branch-a namespace

MODULE 3
################################

In this Module we are going to use Regional Edge to deploy promo service and use HTTP LB to connect it to the BuyTime Online deployment on CE. In order to do that, we will need to create a RE virtual site, assign the created RE and CE sites to the virtual K8s, after that deploy our deals module and create HTTP LB for the lightning deals.   

------------------------------------------------------------
Deploy online store module to vK8s
------------------------------------------------------------

In order to deploy online store module to the created vK8s, we need to replace **online-store.f5-cloud-demo.com** string with your domain name in the file **ce-vk8s-online-store.yaml** before running a deployment. You can do that with the following commands or manually in the text editor.

::
    
    # For Linux
    > sed -i 's/online-store.f5-cloud-demo.com/your_domain.example.com/g' ./deployments/ce-vk8s-online-store.yaml

    # For Windows
    > (Get-Content ./deployments/ce-vk8s-online-store.yaml) | ForEach-Object { $_ -replace 'online-store.f5-cloud-demo.com', 'your_domain.example.com' } | Set-Content ./deployments/ce-vk8s-online-store.yaml

::

    > kubectl --kubeconfig ./your_vk8s_kubeconfig.yaml apply -f ./deployments/ce-vk8s-online-store.yaml

    deployment.apps/mysql-deployment created
    service/mysql-service created
    deployment.apps/wordpress-deployment created
    service/wordpress-service created
    deployment.apps/online-store-deployment created
    service/online-store-service created


To verify deployment we can execute following command:

::

    > kubectl --kubeconfig ./your_vk8s_kubeconfig.yaml get deployments

Distributed Cloud Services support automatic certificate generation and management. You can either `delegate your domain to Distributed Cloud Services <https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/how-to/app-networking/domain-delegation>`_ or add the CNAME record to your DNS records in case you do not delegate the domain to Distributed Cloud Services. See `Automatic Certificate Generation <https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/ves-concepts/load-balancing-and-proxy#automatic-certificate-generation>`_ for certificates managed by Distributed Cloud Services. See `Delegate Domain <https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/how-to/app-networking/domain-delegation>`_ for more information on how to delegate your domain to Distributed Cloud Services.

If you don't use Delegated Domain, then open the menu of the created HTTP LB and proceed to **Manage Configuration**.

Wrap-Up
###########################

At this stage, you should have deployed a WooCommerce sample app which is representative of a traditional 3-tier app architecture: backend + database + frontend. The F5 Distributed Cloud Services provided easy deployment and secure networking of these app services to realize a distributed app model, spanning across: CE public cloud, Retail Branch (AppStack on a private cloud), an RE. Our fictitious retailer BuyTime is set up to use xC AppStack and has a consistent deployment topology for an in-store Kiosk shopping experience. This topology can run in multiple Retail Branches with identical configuration, management, and security policy applied.

We hope you have a better understanding of the F5 Distributed Cloud platform (xC) capabilities and are now ready to implement them for your own organization. Should you have any issues or questions, please feel free to raise them via GitHub. Thank you!
